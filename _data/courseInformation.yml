      "Embedded systems are everywhere – and Arm-based technologies are the industry standard. Getting started could not be easier. This course includes instructions on how to access to an Mbed simulator (refer to the prerequisites section for more details) so you can apply your new knowledge and skills to prototype and build real-world embedded applications quickly, without the trouble or expense of sourcing hardware.
                      From the mobile, wearable, and smart devices of today to the transformative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G powered Internet of Things (IoT) of the near future, embedded systems are the fundamental building blocks of our connected world. As we move from billions to trillions of intelligent, connected devices, it’s crucial that the next generation of engineers have a thorough understanding of how to rapidly build and deploy a modern embedded system solution.
                      In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of an embedded system and discover why the Arm architecture and processors are particularly well suited for IoT applications.
                      Our interactive labs have been designed to cover the technical fundamentals, developing in-demand skills essential for any aspiring embedded systems engineer.
                      You will begin by learning the characteristics of an embedded system, its components, benefits, and constraints, identify cost-performance trade-offs, and explore why the Arm architecture and processors are particularly well suited for the IoT.
                      You will then apply your new knowledge of digital and analog I/O, interrupts, low power features, timer and pulse width modulation to program an audio wave generator and audio player, and control peripherals along the way.
                      All of this will be supported by the Mbed API – so no additional hardware is required, you can download and use the simulator right on your own computer.
                      Over the six modules, you will gain a key overview of:
                      Embedded systems and their importance in modern computing applications
                      Industry-standard Arm-based microcontroller architecture, their features and programming models.
                      The possibilities for future IoT development and connection are enormous. In order to achieve this vision of the future, many engineers and developers will be needed to imagine and design these connected devices and the technologies they are built on.
                      The world of embedded systems is your doorway into the IoT, and all the opportunities it has to offer."

  - title: AI at the Edge on ARM - Understanding and Deploying LLMs for Mobile Devices
    description: |
      The rapid rise of AI applications is making a transformational impact on society, reshaping our business and personal lives. In addition, the ubiquitous availability of mobile devices now able to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve real-world problems represents the next exciting evolutionary stage in the development of AI applications.
                      This course will answer three fundamental questions related to the rise of mobile AI:
                      1. What are the technological trends driving AI to the edge?
                      2. What are the tools and techniques required to deploy LMs on Arm-powered mobile devices?
                      3. Why is Arm the best-placed platform to harness the advantages of LMs on the edge?
                      We’ll start your learning journey by taking you through the basics of AI at the edge and deploying LMs on Arm-based mobile devices. We’ll then introduce you to the tools needed to make this happen, with a focus on how to optimise LMs on mobile devices using model compression techniques such as pruning and quantisation.
                      Along the way, our practical lab exercises will show you how to implement LMs on a mobile device, and all you’ll need is an Arm-powered phone to get started.
                      We’ll also feature key engineers from Arm discussing current and future developments in AI at the edge, providing you with industry relevant insights into the evolution of this exciting new technology.
                      The course will target early and mid-career professionals looking to upskill or supplement their CVs, or undergraduates with programming experience.
                      AI at the edge is powered by Arm. Discover the tools and techniques you’ll need to deploy LMs on ubiquitous Arm-based mobile phones by enrolling in this course today!

  - title: Introduction to System on Chip Design
    description: |
      System-on-Chip (SoC) technology is the backbone of modern smart systems - from smartphones and tablets to autonomous vehicles and embedded IoT devices. But what exactly goes into designing an SoC?
                    Introduction to System-on-Chip (SoC) offers a basic overview of how entire systems are integrated onto a single silicon chip. Starting with basic concepts and progressing through architecture, design flows, and real-world implementation, this course gives you the knowledge to understand how SoCs are structured, designed, and fabricated.
                    You’ll examine the key functional blocks of an SoC, including processors, memory subsystems, interconnects, and peripherals. You’ll learn about front-end and back-end design methodologies, hardware-software co-design, and the role of EDA tools in managing complexity.
                    The course is ideal for beginners who want to enter the semiconductor industry or deepen their knowledge of integrated systems design.

  - title: Introduction to Very Large-Scale Integration Design
    description: |
      Integrated circuits (ICs) are at the heart of every electronic device we use today, from smartphones to spacecraft. But how are these tiny, powerful systems created?
                    Introduction to VLSI provides a comprehensive beginner-friendly look into the world of Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI). You’ll follow the entire chip design journey, starting with silicon purification and wafer creation, through to digital logic, chip packaging, and modern industry tools.
                    Explore the historical evolution of computing hardware, from vacuum tubes to transistors and Moore’s Law. Learn how modern chips are developed using Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, and discover how technologies like ASICs, FPGAs, CMOS, and MOSFETs power our digital lives.
                    Through engaging videos and clearly explained technical concepts, you’ll gain confidence with essential terminology such as ASICs, FPGAs, HDL, RTL, CMOS, MOSFETs, and GDSII files, and understand their real-world applications.
                    The course breaks down complex topics into intuitive, engaging explanations with real-world context. Whether you’re a student, engineer, or tech enthusiast, this course opens the gateway to chip design and the future of electronics.
