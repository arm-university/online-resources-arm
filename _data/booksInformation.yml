    description: |
      “Digital Signal Processing using Arm Cortex‑M Based Microcontrollers: Theory and Practice” by Cem Ünsalan, M. Erkin Yücel, and H. Deniz Gürhan is a university‑level textbook that bridges the gap between DSP theory and hands‑on implementation using low-cost Arm Cortex‑M microcontrollers, particularly the STM32F4 Discovery board  ￼ ￼ ￼. It introduces foundational DSP concepts—like signals and systems, sampling and anti-aliasing, FIR and IIR filter design, frequency transforms (DTFT, DFT, FFT), z-transform analysis, and adaptive filtering (LMS, NLMS)—through structured theory chapters followed by practical lab exercises . Each chapter features hands-on labs that demonstrate real-time implementations using the CMSIS‑DSP library, and end-of-chapter exercises with online solutions to reinforce learning  ￼ ￼. Designed for ECE, EE, and CS courses, this book gives students and hobbyists the confidence to implement DSP algorithms in C on resource-constrained Cortex‑M microcontrollers and apply them in real-world embedded applications.

  - title: Operating Systems Foundations with Linux on the Raspberry Pi 
    description: |
      At the heart of any modern computer device sits the operating system and if the device is a smartphone, IoT node, data centre server or supercomputer, then this is very likely to be Linux.
      This textbook provides a practical introduction to the foundations of modern operating systems, with a focus on GNU/Linux and the Arm platform. It explains operating systems theory and concepts but grounds them in practical use through illustrative examples of their implementation in GNU/Linux, as well as making the connection with the Arm hardware supporting the OS functionality. An ideal starting point if you want to learn about operating systems but keep a practical, real-world focus.

  - title: Fundamentals of System-on-Chip Design on Arm Cortex-M Microcontrollers 
    description: |
      This textbook aims to provide learners with an understanding of embedded systems built around Arm Cortex-M processor cores, a popular CPU architecture often used in modern low-power SoCs that target IoT applications. Readers will be introduced to the basic principles of an embedded system from a high-level hardware and software perspective and will then be taken through the fundamentals of microcontroller architectures and SoC-based designs. Along the way, key topics such as chip design, the features and benefits of Arm’s Cortex-M processor architectures (including TrustZone, CMSIS and AMBA), interconnects, peripherals and memory management are discussed.
      The material covered in this book can be considered as key background for any student intending to major in computer engineering and is suitable for use in an undergraduate course on digital design.

  - title: Modern System-on-Chip Design on Arm 
    description: |
      Textbook by Dr. David Greaves
      Discover the fundamentals and latest developments in modern SoC design using Arm Cortex-A technology as the demonstrator platform.
      The aim of this textbook is to expose aspiring and practising SoC designers to the fundamentals and latest developments in SoC design and technologies using examples of Arm Cortex-A technology and related IP blocks and interfaces. The entire SoC design process is discussed in detail, from memory and interconnects through to validation, fabrication and production. A particular highlight of this textbook is the focus on energy efficient SoC design, and the extensive supplementary materials which include a SystemC model of a Zynq chip.
      This textbook is targetted at final year undergraduate students, master students or engineers in the field looking to update their knowledge. It is assumed that readers will have a pre-existing understanding of RTL, Assembly Language and Operating Systems.
      For those readers looking for a entry-level introduction to SoC design, we recommend our Fundamentals of System-on-Chip Design on Arm Cortex-M Microcontrollers textbook.

  - title: System-on-Chip Design with Arm Cortex-M Processors 
    description: |
      The Arm Cortex-M processors are already one of the most popular choices for loT and embedded applications, with over 45 billion chips shipped worldwide to date. Written by Arm Distinguished Engineer Joseph Yiu, this reference book takes an expert look at all the key topics that System-on-Chip (SoC) and FPGA designers need to know when incorporating Cortex-M processors into their designs.
      It discusses on-chip bus protocol specifications (AMBA, AHB, and APB), used by Arm processors and a wide range of on-chip digital components such as memory interfaces, peripherals, and debug components. Software development and advanced design considerations are also covered. It concludes with ‘Putting the system together’, a designer’s eye view of a simple microcontroller-like design based on the Cortex-M3 processor.

  - title: Arm Helium Technology M-Profile Vector Extension (MVE)
    description: |
      Helium brings exciting new capabilities to microcontrollers, allowing sophisticated digital signal processing or machine learning applications to be run on inexpensive, low-power devices. In the early chapters, the book introduces fundamental concepts at a very basic and accessible level, including Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD), vector processing, floating and fixed-point data representations, and saturation. After an overview of the MVE architecture, the instruction set is broken down into clear groups for discussion, covering subjects like pipeline structure, predication and branch handling, data processing and memory access.
      The most practical sections of the book deal with the mechanics of coding for a Helium-capable core such as the Cortex-M55, including compilation, debug and optimization. Finally, the book concludes with chapters on how to implement DSP and ML workloads.
      The book is intended to be useful to engineers and students who want to learn more about these new features. Knowledge of Cortex-M processors and basic DSP theory is assumed, and some prior knowledge of C and Arm assembly language is a prerequisite.
